In today’s society, a high proportion of marriages end in divorce. Unsurprisingly, one of the leading causes of divorce are extramarital affairs. An extramarital affair is an illicit or sexual relationship outside of marriage. 

The aim of this report is to analyse the potential predictors of infidelity, and to use logistic regression to see which variables have the highest impact on an individual engaging in an extramarital affair. This will be done by analysing the dataset from Ray Fair in his widely cited “Theory of Extramarital Affairs” (Fair, 1978). The infidelity data, colloquially known as ‘Fair’s affairs’ is data from a cross-sectional survey conducted by Psychology Today in 1969. The dataset consists of 601 observations on nine variables.
